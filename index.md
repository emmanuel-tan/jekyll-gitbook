# Hello! My name is Emmanuel. 
I have recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in sunny Singapore. My degree is a double major in biological sciences and psychology. 
I am deeply fascinated by what both fields bring to humanity, but I found a real excitement in what computational biology is able to unveil and have pursued that ever since.

Right now, I am currently seeking opportunities to deepen my expertise and hopefully contribute to some meaningful research.
