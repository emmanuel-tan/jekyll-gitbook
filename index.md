# Hello! My name is Emmanuel. 
I have recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in sunny Singapore. My degree is a double major in biological sciences and psychology. 
I am deeply fascinated by what both fields bring to humanity, but I found a real excitement in what computational biology is able to unveil and have pursued that ever since.

Right now, I am currently seeking opportunities to deepen my expertise and hopefully contribute to some meaningful research. 

## Experience
Illumina, Software R&D; Software Informatics Intern; July 2024 - December 2024

<!-- At Illumina, I worked on optimising a bioinformatics algorithm for GPU parallelization, as well as tailoring research software to meet collaborator's requests.  -->

Johnson & Johnson, Asia Pacific Strategy Organisation; Regional Neuroscience Marketing and Operations Intern; January 2024 - June 2024

<!-- At J&J, I supported the regional neuroscience team in developing marketing narrative and synthesizing research and clinical trial outcomes. I also supported the Asia Pacific operations team in driving employee engagement through strategic culture-building events. -->
