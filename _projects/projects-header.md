# Projects 

Although I call these projects, you will find they vary in size and complexity. Sometimes, it's just me trying a new library, other times it'll be more math heavy and intense. Usually, the scope of these projects will be focused on computational biology, but I occasionally dabble in front-end work, more conventional data analysis, low-end code (CUDA), and machine learning.
